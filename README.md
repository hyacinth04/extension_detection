## Browser Extension Security Audit

**Objective:** Audit web browsers (Chrome and Edge) to identify and remove potentially malicious or unnecessary extensions, thereby minimizing the system's attack surface.

### Audit Result & Deliverable Summary

A full audit of all installed extensions was completed following the established mini-guide (review, check permissions, research risks, and document).

* **Browsers Audited:** Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
* **Extensions Reviewed:** Google Docs Offline, Cat-in-Tab, Grammarly, Netflix Party/Teleparty, and TwoSeven Extension.
* **Final Conclusion:** **No suspicious or malicious extensions were found.** All installed items were verified as legitimate and necessary for current use. The core deliverable (a list of extensions found and removed) is zero.

### Security Takeaway

Malicious extensions are a significant risk because they can steal sensitive data, hijack browsing activity, and act as vectors for complex attacks. The audit reinforces the security best practice of only installing extensions from trusted sources and regularly auditing installed items to minimize the browser's attack surface.
